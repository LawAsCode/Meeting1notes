Teaching lawyers to be hackers
    Basic as possible
        CS undergrads
        now Social science / humanities
            never written a line of code
        Justifications for teaching code
    Now
        Teach them a little language
        how to communicate with technologists
    E.g.
        2 law students with Suffolk Law School
            no programming experience
            trained them to do the things needed done
        Public project
            not that interesting
                jquery mobile static website
                up on GitHub
        idiosyncratic case management systems
            hardly documented
            tech people don't understand
                'need a list of all individuals who are a client or a codefendant'
            current staff
                don't make connections to the real world
                stuck on the fact that there was a table
                    participants
                    had a role column
                clients were in a different table
            get intern students
                to understand enough
                    doing SQL queries
                    reverse engineer databases
                        figure out what info is actually accessible
                by end of semester
                    able to do the SQL queries
            getting credit through the law school
                self-selecting
            did they have to justify what doing as worthwhile legal pedagogy?
                looking on it as pro bono owkr
                working with the public defender
    issue
        if it looks like pure tech
            how do we justify it as a worthwhile experience?

            jQuery Mobile
                javascript library
                produces nice mobile frameworks for HTML
                spent most time doing this
                shadowed people in different practice areas
                    knowing what was important to have on hand in court
                what do you need (in different divisions)
                dealing with existing code base
                    many broken links
                    "go fix the broken links"
                        section of links all broken
                            MA Court webpage had changed how they did things
                            hundreds of broken links
                        they were all broken in the same way
                            used a regular expression to fix them all!

        Why teach law students how to code?
            People who are encouraging people about it don't understand it
            intellectual basis
                Teaching students computational reasoning
                look at legal and social problems in computational forms
                take out into their careers as lawyers
                    don't know what they're going to do
            context of a 'learn to code' class

            Most work in
                jsbin
                    HTML
                    js
                    get immediate output
                        easy to share with Judson the work they'd done
        Wrote up a syllabus
            We hope to get to this
                posted on a regular basis to their website
            16 weeks
            loyolalawtech.org
                assignments each week
        1st 2 classes 
            HTML
            CSS
            basic javascript
            o
                Cannot lecture about code
                Cannot do Socratic
                If not typing, not learning anything
                Everyone brings a computer
                    Task for the day
            ChromeCast
                Puts it up on the screen
        Big goal
            have a sample app
                using HTML
                    CSS
                    javascript
                that will all work client side
        Gavel
            learn how to submit data to the API
            and get data back
            creating frontends to deal with APIs somewhere
            e.g.
                pull out all cases dealing with Miranda
        picked up javascript logic
        basic idea
            of CSS
            of Bootstrap
        Solid HTML
        Digital Ocean
            $5 a month
            learn how to install wordpress
            basic set up of their site
                immediate feedback
            before go into learning HTML / CSS and all that
    What are the things that need to be on the syllabus
        What is the minimum necessary to do the computational reasoning?
            problems can be solved computationally
        Want them to have conversations
            MySQL important
                dealing with case management system
                databases
                    when people think tech
                        that's how they're thinking
        Learning how to learn
            Google it
            know what they're looking up
            tech being used today
                is not going to be used in 2 years
        How do we ask the question?
        coding literacy
            coolness notion of having a GitHub account
                able to ask good questions
                able to understand what's going on
            Development Literacy
        till they can segway into meaningful partnerships with existing groups
            get well socialized
    The world is changing
        power and influence are going to people who know how to make computers do things
            lawyers are all about controlling and minpulating power and the nature of that
            to be a better lawyer
                need to udnerstand how machines work
            machinery of society is becoming increasingly machine bound
        more so in 5 years
        We want to give our new attorneys
            Good structures for managing ideas
            not irrelevant to lawyering
            tools for CS
                tools for managing information
        many people writing important code
            are self-taught
                GOOGLE
                Stack Overflow
    Breadth or Depth
        All classes giving you a taste
            not about mastery
        Exposure, ideas
            take what you're exposed them to and run with it
    Alternative approach
        take a very structured programming language
            work through it
            deep ideas
                that will translate
                    and have persistence as systems involved
            problem
                lack of satisfaction
        element to these classes
            have to be 'fun'
                need an outcome
            Prefer
                project based
    What if
        requirement for admission to law school
            had to already know development

                T
            where they have to blend together
                Most PMs are faking it
        people who can communicate well
            charge much more if you bring B, L, T together
            meeting business goals
                understanding technical constraints
    Understand
        how it works in reality
        or connecting people to do it
        skills that you can transfer
            produce a way of thinking
    Development lifecycles
        Agile?
        Whatever can make it go...
        Difference between waterfall and agile
            having users communicate with developers
            how that is usually not very good
                make it expliclty part of development literacy
        How do you do a Scrum
            Project goal
        e.g. Client Counselling
            elicit the right facts
            communicating
            confirming what said
                facilitate
    When debrief interns
        Great if could start in Fall and do over the course of the year
    Mixed group...
        glad didn't get engineering students
            had to learn how to do it
            knew that they would have divided and conquered
    After the course
        e.g. meet our CfA brigade
            participate in a hackathon as a true participant
        teach them to be the self-taught coder
            jump in hit the ground running
        relationship building
            becoming GC at the next great startup
            Clients!
            or help firm acquire tech
    LegalHackers
        develop a curricula
            that can be used at law schools
            modular
        e.g.
            add a little more to the US Citation statutes
            something that contributes to the community
                resume bullets
            need to know regular expressions!

    Outcomes
        Commit to sharing syllabi
        Put together a set of hackable projects
            what could you do in 2 weeks
        Commit to some  location
            where all share what working on
                in a way to allow cross-use of materials
        Make it a GitHub organization
