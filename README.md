Fundamental Principal #3:  

As part of their responsibility to assist in providing access to law and justice,
law schools should use their legal knowledge and technological capabilities to
make the law more comprehensible and readily available to the public so as to
empower people to use the law and, where appropriate, lawyers, to improve the 
quality of their lives, and should include in this endeavor, among other initiatives,
working with national, state, and local governments to provide the public with
free on-line access to statutes, regulations, cases and other primary law at all
levels of government.

Fundamental Principal #4:  

In order to encourage community economic development and contribute to a strong
global economy, law schools should educate lawyers who can stimulate entrepreneurship
and innovation and assist in developing technology that can support economically
viable means of providing affordable legal services to small businesses,
social ventures and start-up enterprises.
````
````
Fundamental Principal #5:  

Because technology has the potential to reinvent the processes of law in ways
that can help achieve access to justice, law schools should encourage their
students, faculty and graduates to research, teach and implement non-traditional,
technological approaches to legal innovation that will maximize the ways in which
individuals and entities can achieve the benefits of law and legal process.
